<p style="font-size:20px;">
In computer networking, a network service is an application running at the network 
application layer and above, that provides data storage, manipulation, presentation, 
communication or other capability which is often implemented using a client-server
or peer-to-peer architecture based on application layer network protocols.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Each service is usually provided by a server component 
running on one or more computers (often a dedicated server computer 
offering multiple services) and accessed via a network by client components 
running on other devices. However, the client and server components can both be
 run on the same machine. </p>
